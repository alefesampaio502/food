# Sistemaa de delivery feito com 4 Framework

## Aprenda a criar um Sistema Web de Food Delivery em PHP utilizando o Framewrok Codeigniter 4?
Sistema de Food Delivery com Codeigniter 4
Nesse Sistema de Food Delivery com Codeigniter 4, você aprenderá a codificar de forma produtiva, sem enrolação, estritamente focado na prática, utilizando o padrão MVC (Model, View, Controller), fazendo uso de um dos mais poderosos framework PHP da atualidade: O Codeigniter, na versão 4.


## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
